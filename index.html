        <h1>How does climate change impact my daily life?</h1>

          You've heard the same warnings again and again on the news - Just a few degrees of climate change would spell disaster for our planet. You've heard about the wildfires and sea level rise. But have you seen the impacts in your everyday life?
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          The lack of connection between climate change and your everyday life can make it difficult to connect with sometimes, but here I'll explore just a few ways that this boils down into everyday costs in your life regardless of whether you're in an area with wildfires, or have been impacted by extreme weather. As it turns out, the impacts of climate change are far-reaching and will impact everyone's economic well-being if steps are not taken to mitigate the impacts.

          In 2024, <a href="#10.3386/w32450">Bilal and Känzig</a>, two climate economic researchers, found that every degree Celsius of warming caused a global drop in GDP of around 20%. While a degree may not seem significant, the global impacts on complex climate system caused by this single degree are enough to cause a drop of 20% in global productivity due to the costs of climate impacts. If we allow temperatures globally to climb by 2°C by the year 2100, we see a roughly 30% reduction in welfare value, which corresponds to everyday quality of life.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          In this scenario, they estimate the cost of carbon emissions to be $1,500 per metric ton emitted. This accounts for all the damage that this carbon will do once it enters the atmosphere and its corresponding economic impact on humans. Importantly, climate impacts are global, so everyone is impacted regardless of their individual choices<sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup>. We can combine this number with the average annual emissions per capita in Canada, thanks to <a href="#owid-canada">Our World In Data</a>, of 13.42 tonnes, and calculate that each person in Canada is costing the world $20,130 per year in the worst emissions scenario. Clearly, steps must be taken to prevent this! But what is causing these costs?
        </p>
        
        <p class="footnote" id="footnote1">[1] It's worth noting that impacts are often <i>unequal</i> and often burden people who are <i>not</i> emitting the most carbon, but that's beyond the scope of this article.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section style-a">
        <h1>Causes of Climate Costs</h1>
        <p class="body-text">You may not think too much about what climate change means day-to-day. But the cost is very real. Check out a few examples below of how it can impact your daily life.</p>
        
        <h2>Food Inflation</h2>
        <a href="FoodInflation.webp" target="_blank"><img class="block-image" src="FoodInflation.webp"></img></a>
        <p class="footnote" style="text-align:center;">Figure provided by <a href="#10.1038/s43247-023-01173-x">the paper below</a></p>
        <p class="body-text">Take a look at that those graphs above in <a href="#10.1038/s43247-023-01173-x">a paper published by several climate researchers in the world-renowned journal <i>Nature</i></a>. Pay close attention to the map labeled "a," which shows how much food prices are expected to increase year-by-year. You can also see this in the graph labeled "c." Graphs are labeled by date (2035 or 2060) and by emissions scenario. The emissions scenario indicates how much carbon we've decided to emit. In a high-emissions scenario, we haven't put in controls to prevent carbon emissions and have continued burning fossil fuels. In low emissions scenarios, we've properly reduced our emissions. SSP585 is a high emissions scenario, while SSP126 is much lower. Under all scenarios, the inflation hovers around 1.5 to 2 percent <i>each year</i>. While it's similar in 2060 under the low emissions scenario, it jumps to around 4 percent in the high emissions scenario.</p>
        <p class="body-text"><b>That means that if we emit too much carbon into the atmosphere, these researchers estimate that food prices will climb by four percent <i>every year</i> by the year 2060 due to climate alone.</b> In the current cost-of-living crisis, these numbers could spell disaster. The impacts are already here: These researchers also point out the impacts of the summer 2022 heat wave on food prices in Europe. They estimate a 0.67% impact on food inflation and a 0.34% impact on general inflation. While this may not sound like much, these impacts will only continue to grow.</p>
        
        <h2>Home Insurance</h2>
        <a href="Insurance.webp" target="_blank"><img class="block-image" src="Insurance.webp"></img></a>
        <p class="footnote" style="text-align:center;">Figure provided by <a href="#10.1002/wics.1462">the paper below</a></p>
        <p class="body-text">We've all seen the news clips of flooding and wildfires taking out peoples' homes. But have you ever wondered how all these damages are paid for? The answer is home insurance. However, as extreme weather events become more frequent and stronger under climate change, insurance researchers <a href="#10.1002/wics.1462">are trying to figure out the total cost</a>. With the increased cost of climate-related burdens, these costs will be passed down to the consumer. <b>This means it will be more expensive for you to buy or rent a home.</b> Insurance companies have already started simply <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/18/1198912918/home-insurance-rates-are-rising-due-to-climate-change-what-could-break-that-cycl" target="_blank">denying coverage to people who have homes in risky areas due to climate change</a>, which leaves these people with a home they will have trouble selling and can't afford to protect.</p>
        
        <h2>Human Health</h2>
        <blockquote>"The cumulative death toll from climate change since 2000 will pass 4 million in 2024 — more than the population of Los Angeles or Berlin."</blockquote>
        <p class="body-text">When you think of climate change, human health may not be the first thing that comes to mind. However, climate change is already having a significant impact on human health. In a paper published in 2024 again in the journal <i>Nature</i> researcher <a href="#10.1038/s41591-023-02765-y">Colin Carlson argues that climate change should be taken more seriously as a cause of global health problems</a>. He points to increases in mortality caused by extreme weather events, climate-associated famine and poverty, and increased spread of disease due to climate change. He also points out that climate-related deaths have exceeded every WHO-recognized health emergency except COVID. Finally, it's important to note that research in this area is lacking and these effects are poorly understood. As Carlson points out, more work needs to be done to estimate these impacts, but we can expect healthcare costs to increase as a result, which adds more burden to already overstressed systems.</p>

        <h1>So what can we do?</h1>
        <a href="ipcc.png" target="_blank"><img class="block-image" src="ipcc.png"></img></a>
        <p class="body-text">The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was created to answer this exact question, which you can view in their <a href="#10.59327/IPCC/AR6-9789291691647.001">executive summary for policymakers</a>. Importantly, as you can see in part c of the figure above, the amount of warming depends very strongly on how much we emit, which, in turn, changes the level of impacts we see day-to-day. The IPCC notes that "Adaptation planning and implementation has progressed across all sectors and regions,
with documented benefits and varying effectiveness." In short, we have the tools we need to address these challenges to some degree, we just have to enact them. Hence, the most important thing that you can do is <i>vote</i>.</p>
